# Wildfires detection from multispectral image through tensorial techniques and artificial intelligence
When combined with data analysis and advanced classification techniques, this approach allows for the precise identification of wildfires. 
A key challenge when using classifiers is the high processing time caused by the large dimensionality of the dataset. To address this, dimensionality reduction techniques are applied to reduce the computational load on classifiers. One such method, based on tensor algebra, is Non-negative Tucker Decomposition (NTD). Additionally, the dataset used for classification is often imbalanced, with unequal representation across classes. Therefore, it is important to assess classifier performance using metrics that account for the biases introduced by unbalanced datasets.
