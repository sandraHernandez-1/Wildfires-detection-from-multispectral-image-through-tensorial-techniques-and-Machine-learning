# Wildfires detection from multispectral image through tensorial techniques and Machine Learning 
When combined with data analysis and advanced classification techniques, this approach allows for the precise identification of wildfires. 
A key challenge when using classifiers is the high processing time caused by the large dimensionality of the dataset. To address this, dimensionality reduction techniques are applied to reduce the computational load on classifiers. One such method, based on tensor algebra, is Non-negative Tucker Decomposition (NTD). Additionally, the dataset used for classification is often imbalanced, with unequal representation across classes. Therefore, it is important to assess classifier performance using metrics that account for the biases introduced by unbalanced datasets.

The case study is carried out through the use of Landsat 8 multispectral images, extracted from the Mendocinos, Los Angeles USA wildfire on the date of April 04, 2018. For the experiments, a new image of 256 x 256 (region of interest) was obtained from the original image of 7500 x 7530 pixels, the area is mainly composed of wildfires, smoke, water and vegetation pixels.
